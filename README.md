Question 11:
We have a product, say a pen. For each day of the year create a record of for sales of pens.
The record will have the units sold, the price, and the amount (units*price). The price and the
units would be random numbers within the range. The price can be between 20 and 30. The
units can be between 100 - 1000. But the price will remain the same for each month. Once the
data is created compute and output the following.
1. For each month the units sold and the amount
2. For each quarter the units sold and the amount.
3. The quarter which had the maximum sale in terms of amount.
4. The quarter that had the maximum sales in terms of units
Hint : Reduction of one array into smaller arrays
